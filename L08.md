# Introduction

This lab is intended to give you practice with using the `fdisk`, `mount` and `find` commands.

## `fdisk`

1. Execute the command

     ```sh
     $ ls -l /dev/sd*
     ```
which device has multiple partitions associated with it?

2. Use `fdisk` to examine the partition table.

     ```sh
     $ sudo fdisk /dev/sda

     Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.27.1).
     Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
     Be careful before using the write command.


     Command (m for help): p
     ```
Answer the following questions:
    * What is the total size of the drive in GiB?
    * What is the size of a sector in bytes?
    * How many sectors are there?
    * Calculate the total size of the drive in bytes, based on the number of sectors and the number of bytes per sector. Convert your answer to GiB. Does this answer match your answer above for the total size of the drive?
    * Which partitions are Windows partitions?
    * Which partitions are Linux partitions?
    * Which is the Linux swap partition?

## `mount` and `umount`

1. Create a directory to act as a mount point, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ mkdir mnt
     ```

2. Enter a command to mount the larger of the Windows partitions shown in the `fdisk` output above. Use your new mount point `mnt`. Remember that
the `mount` command is used like this: `sudo mount <partition name> <mount point>`

3. Enter a command to find out how many log files (files with the extension `.log`) there are in the `Windows` directory of the newly mounted partition.

4. What happens if you try to mount the same partition again?

5. A file system can be "unmounted" using the command `umount`. The `umount` command is used with the name of the directory where the file system is
mounted, e.g. `sudo umount mnt`. Use this command to unmount the Windows partition that you mounted earlier.

6. Download a raw disk image, using the command below.

     ```sh
     wget rtlab1/kf4005/raw_disk_image
     ```

7. Use `fdisk` to examine the partition table of the raw disk image. Answer the following questions.
    * What is the total size of the drive in GiB?
    * What is the size of a sector in bytes?
    * How many sectors are there?
    * Calculate the total size of the drive in bytes, based on the number of sectors and the number of bytes per sector. Convert your answer to GiB. Does this answer match your answer above for the total size of the drive?
    * Which partitions are Linux partitions?
    * Which is the Linux swap partition?

8. Enter a command to mount the first Linux partition in the raw disk image to your mount point. Remember that you need to use the `loop` option so that
`mount` sees the raw disk image file as a block device. You also need to specify the offset of the partion in bytes, using the `offset` option. Refer to
the [lecture slides](http://hesabu.net/kf4005/assets/ra/B09.pdf) if you need a reminder about how to do this.

9. How many `.txt` files are there in the `/usr/share/doc/git` directory of the file system that you have just mounted?

## `find`

`find` is a very powerful command that can be used to explore a file system. You call it by specifying the directory from which you want the exploration to begin.
For example, `find /` will just list all the files in the file system (you may need to use `sudo` to avoid `permission denied` errors for those directories that
you do not have permission to read). If you just want to list the files starting at the `/bin` directory, use `find /bin`. Some very useful options with
`find` are

    * `-name` : restrict your search to files whose names match a pattern, e.g.

```sh
$ find /usr/share -name "*.txt"
```
finds all `.txt` files, starting at the `/usr/share` directory.

    * `-exec` : execute a command on each file that matches the search, e.g.

```sh
$ find /usr/share -name "*.txt" -exec grep Linux {} \;
```
finds all `.txt` files, starting at the `/usr/share` directory, which contain the string `Linux`. You can print out the name of each matching file by adding the
`-print` option, e.g.

```sh
$ find /usr/share -name "*.txt" -exec grep Linux {} \; -print
```

    * `-printf` : print file metadata, e.g.

```sh
$ find /bin -printf "%Ax;%p"
```
prints the last access data and the file names of all of the files in the `/bin` directory. Use `man find` and look at the `-printf` option for all the metadata
and formatting possibilities.

Develop your own ideas about useful data and how to display it. Experiment using the command line.
