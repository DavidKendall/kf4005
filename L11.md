# Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to give you further practice with the lab notebook and the format of the assessed lab that will be held next week.

## Instructions

1. Check to make sure that you are working at a machine where the lab notebook software has been installed, e.g.

    ```
    $ ls ~/miniconda3/bin
    ```
where you should get output that lists a program called `jupyter` as one of the files. If you do see the file `jupyter` in your listing, then you can skip to 2. below. If you don't get such output, then you need to install the lab
notebook software, as follows:

    ```
    $ wget rtlab1/kf4005/install_notebook.sh
    $ chmod +x install_notebook.sh
    $ ./install_notebook.sh
    ```
You'll be prompted to accept a license agreement. Type `yes` and press `Enter`. You can accept the default answers in all other cases.

2. Download the script `run_notebook` from `rlab1`, make sure it is executable, and move it to `/home/student/.local/bin`, after
you've made sure that there isn't already a copy of `run_notebook` in `/home/student/.local/bin` e.g.

    ```
    $ wget rtlab1/kf4005/run_notebook
    $ chmod +x run_notebook
    $ sudo rm -f ~/.local/bin/run_notebook
    $ mv run_notebook ~/.local/bin
    ```

3. Download the practice lab notebook from `rtlab1`, e.g.

    ```
    $ wget rtlab1/kf4005/practice_lab.ipynb
    ```

4. Run the notebook server,

    ```
    $ run_notebook
    ```
entering the usual password for the `student` account if prompted for a password.

5. Go to the browser window that should have opened (there may be a short delay while this is happening), click on the `practice_lab.ipynb` link and follow the instructions in the notebook

6. When you have finished, make sure that you save the notebook and upload it to the eLP (Blackboard).

7. Enter the terminal window that you used to execute the `run_notebook`
   command and press `Ctrl-C` twice in quick succession. You should get a
   prompt back in the terminal window. You've finished!!
