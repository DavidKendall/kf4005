# Introduction

This is the assessed lab session where you will complete and submit a lab notebook. The lab notebook is worth 50% of the total
module marks.

## Instructions

1. Check to make sure that you are working at a machine where the lab notebook software has been installed, e.g.

    ```
    $ wc ~/.local/bin/run_notebook
    ```
You should see output that looks like this

    ```
    16  44 392 /home/student/.local/bin/run_notebook
    ```
If you do not see this ouput, ask your lab tutor for assistance.

3. Download the assessed lab notebook from `rtlab1`, as follows:

    ```
    $ wget rtlab1/kf4005/assessed_lab.ipynb
    ```

4. Run the notebook server,

    ```
    $ run_notebook
    ```
entering the usual password for the `student` account if prompted for a password.

5. Go to the browser window that should have opened (there may be a short delay while this is happening), click on the `assessed_lab.ipynb` link and follow the instructions in the notebook

6. When you have finished, make sure that you save the notebook and upload it to the eLP (Blackboard) using the link `Assessment->Assessed Lab`.

7. Enter the terminal window that you used to execute the `run_notebook`
   command and press `Ctrl-C` twice in quick succession. You should get a
   prompt back in the terminal window. Delete your script and your lab notebook. You've finished!!
