# Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to give you some practice with the lab notebook software that will be used in the assessed lab and to help you to improve your understanding of POSIX threads.

## Lab Notebook (Jupyter)

The lab notebook software is from the [Jupyter Project](http://jupyter.org/). There is [extensive documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) available. You could browse this in your own time outside this lab session if you're interested. However, the software is very easy to use and you should get started straight away by following the instructions below.

1. Download the script to install the notebook software and run it.

    ``` sh
    $ wget http://hesabu.net/kf4005/install_notebook.sh
    $ chmod +x install_notebook.sh
    $ ./install_notebook.sh
    ```
You'll be prompted to accept a license agreement. Type `yes` and press `Enter`. You can accept the
default answers in all other cases.

2. Create a directory to store your notebooks

    ``` sh
    $ cd 
    $ mkdir notebooks
    ```
3. Go to that directory and download a trial notebook

    ``` sh
    $ cd notebooks
    $ wget http://hesabu.net/kf4005/KF4005_Trial_Notebook.ipynb
    ```
4. Start the notebook server

    ``` sh
    $ run_notebook
    ```
5. Click on the `KF4005_Trial_Notebook.ipynb` link in the browser window. This will open a new window containing the trial
   notebook.

6. Work through the trial notebook, save it and upload your saved copy to the eLP, following the instructions in the notebook.
     
## Threads

1. Create a C program called `forkexample1.c` from the following code

    ``` C
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <sys/wait.h>

    int globvar = 6;

    int main(void) {
     int var = 88;
     pid_t pid;

     printf("before fork\n");
     if ((pid = fork()) < 0) {
         fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
         exit(-1);
     } else if (pid == 0) {
         globvar++; //child
         var++;
         printf("Child : pid = %d, globvar = %d, var = %d\n",
                  getpid(), globvar, var);
     } else {
         waitpid(pid, NULL, 0); // parent
         printf("Parent: pid = %d, globvar = %d, var = %d\n",
                  getpid(), globvar, var);
     }
     exit(0);
    }
    ```
Compile and run the program. Observe the results carefully.

2. Now create a C program called `threadexample1.c` from the following code

    ```
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <pthread.h>

    int globvar = 6;

    void *threadController(void *arg) {
          globvar++; 
          // var++; Notice this variable is not accessible
          printf("New thread : pid = %d, tid = 0x%lx, globvar = %d, "
                  "var = %s\n", getpid(), (unsigned long)pthread_self(),
                  globvar, "Not accessible");
          pthread_exit((void *)0);
    }

    int main(void) {
      int var = 88;
      pthread_t thread;

      printf("before thread create\n");
      if (pthread_create(&thread, NULL, threadController, NULL) != 0) {
          fprintf(stderr, "thread create failed\n");
          exit(-1);
      } else {
          pthread_join(thread, NULL); // main thread
          printf("Main thread: pid = %d, tid = 0x%lx, globvar = %d, " 
                 "var = %d\n", getpid(), (unsigned long)pthread_self(),
                  globvar, var);
      }
      exit(0);
    }
    ```
Compile and run the program. Observe the results carefully.

3. Answer the following questions

    1. Why is the process identifier (`pid`) *different* in the parent and child processes in `forkexample1.c`?
    2. Why is the process identifier (`pid`) *the same* in the main and new threads in `threadexample1.c`?
    3. Why is the value of `globvar` *different* in the parent and child processes in `forkexample1.c`?
    4. Why is the value of `globvar` *the same* in the main thread and new threads in `threadexample1.c`?

4. Consider the following program

    ```
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <pthread.h>
    #include <assert.h>

    #define N_THREADS 5

    void *printMessage(void *arg) {
      int i;

      for (i = 0; i < 100; i += 1) {
        printf("This is a message from thread %ld\n", (long)arg);
      }
      printf("Thread %ld finished\n", (long)arg);
      pthread_exit((void *)0);
    }

    int main(void) {
      pthread_t thread[N_THREADS];
      int rc;
      long i;

      for (i = 0; i < N_THREADS; i += 1) {
        rc = pthread_create(&thread[i], NULL, printMessage, (void *)i);
        assert(rc == 0);
      }

      for (i = 0; i < N_THREADS; i += 1) {
        rc = pthread_join(thread[i], NULL);
        assert(rc == 0);
      }
      printf("Finished\n");
      exit(0);
    }
    ```
Answer the following questions.

    1. How many threads will be created?
    2. Will each thread print the same message? If not, how will the messages differ?
    3. What do you expect the output of the program to be? 
    4. Create a program file, compile and build the program. Run it. Does the output match what you expected? Why (not)?
    5. Run the program several times. Is the output always the same? Why (not)?

5. Modify the previous program so that each thread prints a completely different message from the others.
   HINT: Create an array of messages of the same size as the number of threads. Initialise each element in
   the array of messages to a different string. Use the thread argument as an index into the array of messages.
