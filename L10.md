# Introduction

This lab is concerned with protection and security in a UNIX environment, in
particular with Linux protection and security. There are many aspects to
protection and security but the basis of an approach relies on a good
understanding of users, groups, files and file permissions.  These topics are
the focus of this lab. Make sure that you work through all of the examples and
exercises on a UNIX system.

It would be better to follow these lab instructions using a virtual machine -
an Ubuntu 14.04 server VM or Ubuntu 16.04 desktop VM would be fine. However, if
you don't have a suitable VM available, you can use the Ubuntu host OS in the
labs. Just make sure that you clean up after yourself at the end.

## Users and groups

1. Before you can use a UNIX machine, it is necessary to have a user account
   that allows you to log on to the machine.  A user account can be created by
   a system administrator using the `adduser` command, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ sudo adduser fred
     Adding user `fred' ...
     Adding new group `fred' (1001) ...
     Adding new user `fred' (1001) with group `fred' ...
     Creating home directory `/home/fred' ...
     Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
     Enter new UNIX password:
     Retype new UNIX password:
     passwd: password updated successfully
     Changing the user information for fred
     Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
          Full Name []:
          Room Number []:
          Work Phone []:
          Home Phone []:
          Other []:
     Is the information correct? [Y/n]
     ```
     {: .code}
You can see that a new *user* is added and also a new *group*. A home directory
is created for the new user and it is populated with some files from
`/etc/skel`. You'll need to enter a password at the prompts. You can just press
enter at the other prompts. Try this out.

2. The behaviour of the `adduser` command can be modified by the configuration
   file `/etc/adduser.conf`. Read through the contents of this file on your
   system.

     ```sh
     $ less /etc/adduser.conf
     ```
     {: .code}
Look at the contents of the `/etc/skel` directory to see how a new user's home directory will be initialised.

3. Check that you can log in as the new user that you've created. You can find out information about the current user using the
`id` command, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ id
     uid=1001(fred) gid=1001(fred) groups=1001(fred)
     ```
     {: .code}
Notice the user id (uid), group id (id) and the groups that the user is associated with. Log out of the `fred` account and log in again as
the `student` user. Use the `id` command to discover information about the `student` user, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ id
     uid=1000(student) gid=1000(student) groups=1000(student),4(adm),24(cdrom),
     27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),113(lpadmin),128(sambashare)
     ```
     {: .code}
4. As you can see, a user can belong to more than one group. As well as the `id` command, we can use the `groups` command to find out
which `groups` a user belongs to, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ groups student
     student : student adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare
     ```
     {: .code}
5. A new group can be created using the `addgroup` command, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ sudo addgroup nufc
     ```
     {: .code}
6. A user can be added to the group like this

     ```sh
     $ sudo adduser student nufc
     $ sudo adduser fred nufc
     ```
     {: .code}
This will add the users `student` and `fred` to the `nufc` group.

7. Check that the users have been added using the `groups` command, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ groups student
     $ groups fred
     ```
     {: .code}
Interestingly, if you don't specify the user name, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ groups
     adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare student
     ```
     {: .code}
the new group, `nufc`, does not appear in the list of groups for this user. You can make sure that the user's groups are updated either
by logging out and logging back in again, or by using the `newgrp` command, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ newgrp nufc
     $ groups
     nufc adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare student
     ```
     {: .code}
8. You can list the members of a group using `grep`, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ grep nufc /etc/group
     ```
     {: .code}

## Files and permissions

1. Any files or directories created by a user are *owned* by the user, i.e. associated with the user's id (uid), and
are associated with the group id (gid) of the user's primary group, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ cat >hello.txt <<<"Hello world"
     $ ls -l hello.txt
     -rw-rw-r-- 1 student student 12 Mar 23 08:13 hello.txt
     ```
     {: .code}
Read the [Linux protection and security lecture slides](http://hesabu.net/kf4005/assets/ra/B10.pdf) for more information about the meaning of the permission bits.

2. The permissions associated with a file can be modified using the `chmod` command, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ chmod g-w hello.txt
     $ ls -l hello.txt
     -rw-r--r-- 1 student student 12 Mar 23 08:13 hello.txt
     ```
     {: .code}
3. A number can be used with `chmod` to determine the permissions (see [Linux protection and security lecture slides](http://hesabu.net/kf4005/assets/ra/B10.pdf)), e.g.

     ```sh
     $ chmod 664 hello.txt
     $ ls -l hello.txt
     -rw-rw-r-- 1 student student 12 Mar 23 08:13 hello.txt
     ```
     {: .code}
Enter a command using a numeric argument that would allow the file owner to read and write, the group to read and others to have no access to the
file `hello.txt`.

4. The owner of a file can be changed using the `chown` command, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ sudo chown fred hello.txt
     $ ls -l hello.txt
     -rw-rw-r-- 1 fred student 12 Mar 23 08:13 hello.txt
     ```
     {: .code}
5. The group associated with a file can be changed using the `chgrp` command, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ sudo chgrp nufc hello.txt
     $ ls -l hello.txt
     -rw-rw-r-- 1 fred nufc 12 Mar 23 08:13 hello.txt
     ```
     {: .code}
6. Notice that the order in which permissions are decided is *user* (owner), *group*, then *other*. For example, while logged in as
`student`, remove write permission for the owner from `hello.txt`

     ```sh
     $ sudo chmod u-w hello.txt
     ```
     {: .code}
(Aside: why was `sudo` required here). Then try to write to the file, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ cat >>hello.txt <<<"Goodbye world"
     $ less hello.txt
     Hello world
     Goodbye world
     ```
     {: .code}
Now log in as `fred` and try to write to the file `hello.txt` again. Explain the result that you observe.

7. Normally, when a file is created, e.g. using the `cat` command, a system call will be made to the OS kernel to `open` the file. Usually, the
call to `open` will request read and write privileges for all users. But notice when you created the file `hello.txt` it was created without write
permission for *others*. This is a result of the value of `umask`. Try entering the command

     ```sh
     $ umask
     ```
     {: .code}
you should see it prints the value `0002`. Every time a request is made to open a file, the permissions requested in the call to `open` are bitwise-anded
with the inverse of the `umask` value, e.g.

     ```
     rw- rw- rw-
     110 110 110   (a) permissions requested by open
     000 000 010   (b) umask value
     111 111 101   (c) inverted umask value
     110 110 100   (d) bitwise-and of (a) and (c)
     rw- rw- r--
     ```
     {: .code}
hence the output that we observed with the `ls` command,

     ```sh
     $ ls -l hello.txt
     -rw-rw-r-- 1 student student 12 Mar 23 08:13 hello.txt
     ```
     {: .code}
8. Try changing the `umask` value like this

     ```sh
     $ umask 022
     ```
     {: .code}
then create another file, e.g.

     ```sh
     $ cat >lsbin.sh <<EOF
     > #!/bin/bash
     >
     > ls -l /bin
     > EOF
     $ ls -l lsbin.sh
     -rw-r--r-- 1 student student 25 Mar 23 16:07 lsbin.sh
     ```
     {: .code}
notice that the group does not have write permission.

9. When a request is made to create a directory, e.g. with `mkdir`, the system call to the OS is made to request
read, write and execute permissions for all users. In this case, too, the permissions are bitwise-anded with the
inverted `umask` value, e.g.

     ```
     rwx rwx rwx
     111 111 111   (a) permissions requested by open
     000 000 010   (b) umask value
     111 111 101   (c) inverted umask value
     111 111 101   (d) bitwise-and of (a) and (c)
     rwx rwx r-x
     ```
     {: .code}
hence,

     ```sh
     $ mkdir stuff
     $ ls -ld stuff
     drwxrwxr-x 2 student student 4096 Mar 24 07:41 stuff
     ```
     {: .code}
