## Introduction

Your objectives for the lab today are to make sure that you understand the assignment pecification and to catch up with
the exercises from earlier weeks. There are further exercises involving pipes and commands for memory management.

## Assignment

Download the [assignment specification]({{site.raurl}}/assgn.pdf) and read it carefully. Your lab tutor will talk you through it. Ask about
any aspects that you're not clear about.

## Catch up

Make sure that you have completed all earlier exercises.

## More on pipes

1. Write a C program that writes "Hello named pipe world" to `stdout`. Write a second C program that reads
   a string from `stdin`. Open a terminal window. Create a named pipe. Run your first program with output 
   redirected to the named pipe. Open a second terminal window. Run the second program with input redirected
   from the named pipe. Observe what happens. Use the `ls -l` command to examine the named pipe.
2. Repeat everything above but this time using shell scripts.

## Memory management

Use the following commands in a terminal window. Use the `man` command with each of them to find out what each is doing.

1. `free`
2. `cat /proc/meminfo | less`
3. `vmstat -s`
4. `top`
5. `sudo dmidecode -t 17`
